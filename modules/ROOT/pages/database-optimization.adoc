= Database Optimization

* Primary keys on critical fields
* Indexes on frequently queried columns
* Prepared statements for security
* Connection pooling via Radius::SqlDb

---

* Primary Keys on Critical Fields  
  Ensure unique identification and faster lookups for core tables such as `MACL2USERS` and `LOCTOPACKAGE`.

* Indexes on Frequently Queried Columns 
  Improve query performance for fields like `MAC`, `LOCID`, `REMOTEID`, and `ACCTSESSIONID`.

* Prepared Statements for Security 
  Reduce SQL injection risks and improve execution efficiency for repeated queries.

* Connection Pooling via `Radius::SqlDb`  
  Reuse database connections to reduce overhead and improve overall response time.
